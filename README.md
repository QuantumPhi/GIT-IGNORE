A script used to alias [Zach Latta's Gitignorer](https://github.com/zachlatta/gitignorer) into git, allowing for quick
gitignoring of files.

Put the script in your bin (Generally /usr/bin) to "install".

Put the script in your bin (Generally /usr/bin) to "install".

_WARNING:_

I do not personally own a Mac, so I do not know how this script
will behave in Mac OS. Please open issues or pull requests on
bugs that are found.

Windows

_Coming soon!_
